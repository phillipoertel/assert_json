Test your JSON strings.

## Installation ##

```sh
cd path/to/your/rails-project
./script/plugin install git://github.com/phillipoertel/assert_json.git
```

## Usage ##

```ruby
class MyActionTest < ActionController::TestCase
  include IncludeJson

  def test_my_action
    get :my_action, :format => 'json'
    # => @response.body= '{"key":[{"inner_key1":"value1"},{"inner_key2":"value2"}]}'
    
    # include_json requires the expected structure in the actual json.
    # it allows other stuff in the actual json, however. that's where equal_json will kick in (to be written).
    include_json({
      key: {
        inner_key1: 'value1',
        inner_key2: /lue2/
      }
    }, @response.body)
    
  end

end
```

## Future ##

rspec compatibility: 

```ruby
user_to_json.should include_json({
  name: 'Peter',
  age: /\d+/,
  _links: {
    next: {
      href: /http.+/
    }
  }
})
```
